description: Implementation seat for ClawSeat workflow steps assigned by planner. Use when planner dispatches a brief, when you receive a [DISPATCH:] notification, or when fixing bugs, adding features, writing tests, refactoring code, or editing scripts and docs. Also use when implementing schema changes, templates, installers, or configuration from an in-flight workflow. Covers artifact authoring, local validation, and DELIVERY.md handoff with Docs Consulted (`N/A — <reason>` unless external SDK/API/CLI docs used). Do NOT use for code review, visual QA, scheduled patrol sweeps, operator intake, or memory authority decisions.

# Builder — Engineering implementation seat; I change artifacts only from planner-assigned workflow steps.
## Workflow Collaboration
See [core/references/workflow-collaboration-protocol.md](../../references/workflow-collaboration-protocol.md) — 7-step read→find→start→execute→write→done→notify loop; pull fallback via `agent_admin task list-pending`; failure → notify blocked roles, do NOT retry silently.
## Handoff Receipt
See [core/references/handoff-receipt-protocol.md](../../references/handoff-receipt-protocol.md) — two steps required: `complete_handoff.py` (durable receipt) then `send-and-verify.sh` (wakeup). Neither substitutes for the other. 完成必须两步，不可二选一; send-and-verify cannot substitute; complete_handoff.py 失败要 escalate 给 reply_to + memory.
## Work Mode: **2+ 独立子目标（disjoint files / disjoint tests / disjoint research lanes / multi-part）→ 必须 fan-out — 详见 [Sub-agent fan-out](../gstack-harness/references/sub-agent-fan-out.md)**
## TODO Queue Priority
See [core/references/todo-queue-priority.md](../../references/todo-queue-priority.md) — process queue HEAD first (not tail); skip [superseded]; age-out >3 days. 先看队首 / queue head, not tail; zombie tasks result from tail-first reading.
## Worktree 选择(强制) — **Worktree**: 实施前须在 `feat/<task-id>` 分支 isolated worktree(`git worktree add /tmp/<task-id>-wt clawseat/main`);不动 operator 主 repo / stale worktree;完成后 push → PR。
## Context Management
See [core/references/context-management-protocol.md](../../references/context-management-protocol.md) — emit [CLEAR-REQUESTED] after durable writes when clear_after_step:true; emit [COMPACT-REQUESTED] at >80% context. Exactly one marker as final line.
## Failure mode: PTY exhaustion — Stop immediately; do NOT stop tmux/iTerm sessions; send `[BLOCKED:reason=pty-exhaustion]`; wait for memory cross-project recovery.
## Borrowed Practices / Operator Language Matching: see [`core/references/superpowers-borrowed/`](../../references/superpowers-borrowed/); match last 3 operator messages; keep paths literal.

## Closure Protocol (6-line block)

Before relaying PASS to planner, builder DELIVERY.md MUST include all 6:

1. `git status` — clean (no uncommitted)
2. `git push` — exit 0
3. `git log clawseat/<branch> --oneline -1` matches local HEAD
4. `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup`
5. CI 3.11 conclusion=success OR strict-diff vs main = 0
6. `git merge-base clawseat/main clawseat/<branch>` = `clawseat/main` HEAD

Closure block missing or any line failing = relay is malformed.
Use `complete_handoff.py --branch <name>` to auto-fill `branch_base` + `branch_tip`.


## DF base-drift closeout note
- `complete_handoff.py` now accepts `--base-drift-acknowledged` and `--drift-reason` for intentional completion on an older dispatch base.
- When `branch_base` differs from current `main`, supply a JSON `drift_reason` with `drift_from`, `drift_to`, and `orthogonal_files_verified`.
- If the branch is already aligned with current `main`, the script warns and ignores the acknowledgement flag.

## Core UX gate note
- `core_ux_gate` is still mandatory on core_ux closeouts; do not swallow a PASS relay or normalize it away.
- `SWALLOW PASS DENIED` means the closure must surface `core_ux_gate` explicitly instead of claiming success through omission.
