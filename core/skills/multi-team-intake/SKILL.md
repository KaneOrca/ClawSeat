  Memory-driven project-group designer for ClawSeat v3 multi-team projects.
  Use when the first project memory needs to analyze a repo, recommend a
  module/layer-based team topology, write reviewable config proposals, or
  design an autonomous quality-docs testing group. For applying approved
  roster changes after initial design, pair with clawseat-roster-admin.

# Multi-Team Intake

Use this skill from the first project-level memory seat when a project is being
turned into a ClawSeat v3 project group. The output is a proposal pack, not a
runtime roster: write `*__proposed.yaml` first, ask the operator to approve, and
only then rename or rewrite to `*__approved.yaml`.

## Core Workflow

1. Scan the target repo's current docs, manifests, tests, and major directories.
2. Identify natural module/layer boundaries. Prefer real ownership seams over a
   fixed team count.
3. Recommend a phase-1 topology with small teams and clear path ownership.
4. Include an autonomous `quality-docs` team for products that need continuous
   validation, long-running GUI flows, SDK/provider integration, or release gates.
5. Explain each team: why it exists, which paths it owns, which risks it tests,
   and which acceptance routes it needs.
6. Draft the current-project `TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md` summary for the proposed
   topology. Keep it descriptive only; do not duplicate runtime config.
7. Write proposed YAML files under:

   ```text
   ~/.agents/tasks/<project>/_config-proposals/
   ```

8. Ask for operator approval before producing `__approved.yaml`.
9. After approval, update:

   ```text
   ~/.agents/tasks/<project>/TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md
   ```

   This document is project-local and owned by memory. It records stable team
   and builder capability split; it is not a second config source.
10. Tell the operator the dry-run command:

   ```bash
   scripts/install.sh --mode multi --project <project> --teams <csv> --dry-run
   ```

Memory designs the project group and briefs. Team planners design workflows.
Memory does not write `workflow.md` and does not dispatch directly to builders.
There is one project-level memory. Subteams never include memory seats.

After the operator approves adding a seat or subteam to an already-installed
project, switch to `clawseat-roster-admin`; do not edit project/profile TOML
directly from this skill.

## Minimal Project Group Rules

Every multi-team project starts from:

```text
project-memory
one or more subteams
quality-docs
```

Subteams are execution units:

```yaml
team_type: subteam
scaling_policy:
  max_builders: 3
  reviewer_required_when_builders_gte: 2
  overflow_action: propose_new_subteam
  reviewer_fallback: planner
```

Rules:

1. A subteam has exactly one planner.
2. A subteam has 1-3 builders.
3. With 1 builder, reviewer is optional and planner performs spec/delivery
   review fallback.
4. With 2-3 builders, reviewer is mandatory.
5. With 2-3 builders, every builder seat must declare `instance`, `purpose`,
   and `capabilities` so the subteam planner can choose exact `owner_seat`.
6. A requested 4th builder is forbidden; memory must propose a new subteam
   instead.
7. Each subteam should declare `ownership_paths` so planner can route by module
   boundary.

## Generic Topology Heuristic

Start from these candidate domains, then merge or rename them to match the repo:

| Candidate team | Use when the repo has... |
|---|---|
| `product-surface` | UI, user workflows, front-end state, UX, visible product behavior |
| `runtime-platform` | Electron/CLI/server runtime, SDK adapters, providers, IPC, auth/env, local paths |
| `domain-capability` | Domain skills, content pipelines, asset workflows, business logic, model-specific capabilities |
| `orchestration-ops` | ClawSeat/project-group bridge, launch/restart/recovery, tmux/session automation, install/upgrade |
| `quality-docs` | Continuous testing, human-path simulation, chaos/risk testing, QA docs, release gates |

Do not force all five. A small library might only need `runtime-platform` and
`quality-docs`; a large desktop product may need all five.

## Quality-Docs Rule

`quality-docs` is autonomous. Its planner decides when and how to test; memory
does not decide whether testing is needed. The team runs continuously:

```text
quality-docs-planner
quality-docs-patrol-fast
quality-docs-patrol-human
quality-docs-patrol-chaos
```

Use `instance` for same-role seats:

```yaml
seats:
  - role: planner
    tool: claude
    provider: minimax
    auth_mode: api
  - role: patrol
    instance: fast
    tool: claude
    provider: minimax
    auth_mode: api
  - role: patrol
    instance: human
    tool: claude
    provider: minimax
    auth_mode: api
  - role: patrol
    instance: chaos
    tool: claude
    provider: minimax
    auth_mode: api
```

Planner loop:

1. Scan development queues, workflow docs, deliveries, git diff, open findings,
   flaky history, and risk registers.
2. Create `TestCampaign`s and assign `TestMission`s.
3. Each patrol runs exactly the mission assigned to it, writes evidence, then
   waits for the next mission.
4. If a mission finds nothing, raise the next mission's difficulty.
5. A patrol leaves one campaign only after three consecutive clean rounds for
   that campaign; then planner switches it to a new attack surface.
6. Findings are assigned back to the owning development team for fixes. Patrols
   do not edit product code.

## Proposal Fields

Each normal subteam proposal should include:

```yaml
project: <project>
team: <team>
proposal_status: proposed
team_type: subteam
ownership_paths:
  - src/**
scaling_policy:
  max_builders: 3
  reviewer_required_when_builders_gte: 2
  overflow_action: propose_new_subteam
  reviewer_fallback: planner
seats:
  - role: planner
    tool: claude
    provider: anthropic
    auth_mode: oauth_token
    rationale: "claims this team queue and writes workflow.md"
estimated_monthly_cost_usd:
  low: 0
  high: 20
```

Only autonomous teams such as `quality-docs` add:

```yaml
team_type: quality-docs
autonomous: true
loop: continuous
stop_rule: campaign_clean_streak_3
```

Use `instance` when a team needs more than one seat with the same role. The v3
renderer materializes seat ids as `<team>-<role>-<instance>`.

## TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md

Memory maintains `~/.agents/tasks/<project>/TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md` for the current
project only. Keep it short:

```md
## <team>
Mission: ...
Ownership paths:
- src/...
Seats:
- planner: <team>-planner
- reviewer: <team>-reviewer
- builder-<instance>: purpose; capabilities
Boundaries:
- Not responsible for ...
```

Do not add a planner-owned long-lived builder assignment document. Planner's
per-task split belongs in `tasks/<project>/<team>/workflow/<task_id>.md`; stable
ownership changes are relayed back to memory for this document.

Read `references/generic-project-group.md` when generating a full generic
proposal pack or when the operator asks for the default project-group template.
