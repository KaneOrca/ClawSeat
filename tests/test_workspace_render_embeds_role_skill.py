"""Root-cause fix verification: bootstrap-rendered workspace files must keep
the canonical role SKILL reachable without pasting its long-form body hot.

Before 2026-04-24, `agent_admin_template.py` rendered AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md
/ GEMINI.md purely from engineer.toml fields (mostly empty: `skills=[]`,
a single-line role_details). The authoritative role contract lived in
`core/skills/<role>/SKILL.md` but was not consumed by the render pipeline.

MP008 keeps that role mapping but slims the hot prompt: generated workspaces
now append a compact role skill hot contract that references the full
`core/skills/<role>/SKILL.md` instead of embedding every detailed section.
